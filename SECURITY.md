# Security Policy

## Scope

This security policy applies to all of Lichess's source repositories
and infrastructure, including the domains:

* lichess.org
* lichess1.org
* lichess.ovh

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

Please report security issues to contact@lichess.org.

Like all contributions to Lichess, security reviews and pentesting are
appreciated. Note that we do not currently pay cash bounties.

Vulnerabilities are relevant even when they are not directly exploitable, for
example XSS mitigated by CSP.

When doing your research, please minimize negative impact for other users.
As long as you keep this in mind, testing should not require prior
coordination. Avoid spamming, DDoS and volumetric attacks.

We believe transport encryption will probably be sufficient for all reports.
If you insist on using PGP, please clarify the nature of the message in the
plain-text subject and encrypt for
[multiple recipients](https://lichess.org/.well-known/gpg.asc).
